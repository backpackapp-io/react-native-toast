# `<Toasts />`

Include the `<Toasts />` component in the root of your app.

## Props

### globalAnimationType
`'timing' | 'spring'`

Set the global animation type for all toasts. This can be overridden by the toast options.
```js
<Toasts globalAnimationType="spring" />
```

### globalAnimationConfig
`object`

Set the global animation config for all toasts. This can be overridden by the toast options.
```js
<Toasts globalAnimationConfig={{duration: 500, flingPositionReturnDuration: 200, easing: Easing.elastic(1)}} />
```

### overrideDarkMode
`boolean | undefined`

Override the system dark mode. If a value is supplied (I.e. `true` or `false`), then the toast components will use that value for the dark mode. For example, if `overrideDarkMode = {false}`, dark mode will be disabled, regardless of the system's preferences.

### extraInsets
`object`

Supply the container for the toasts with extra padding.
```
extraInsets?: {
  top?: number;
  bottom?: number;
  right?: number;
  left?: number;
};
```

### onToastShow
`function`

When a toast is shown, this callback will fire, returning the toast object that was shown. _Note, the toast object is "shown" when the toast is mounted._
```
onToastShow?: (toast: T) => void;
```
### onToastHide
`function`

When a toast is hidden, this callback will fire, returning the toast object that was hidden. _Note, the toast object is "hidden" when the toast is unmounted._
```
onToastHide?: (toast: T) => void;
```
### onToastPress
`function`

When a toast is pressed, this callback will fire, returning the toast object that was pressed.
```
onToastPress?: (toast: T) => void;
```

### preventScreenReaderFromHiding
`boolean`

Prevent screen readers from hiding the toast component. This is useful if you want to override the default behavior of screen readers hiding the toast component.

```js
<Toasts preventScreenReaderFromHiding={true} />
```

### defaultStyle
(`object`)

Supply default styles for the toast component. This will be applied to all toasts unless overridden by the toast options.
```
defaultStyle?: {
  view?: ViewStyle;
  pressable?: ViewStyle;
  text?: TextStyle;
  indicator?: ViewStyle;
};
```

### providerKey
`string`

Provide the Toasts component with a providerKey to conditionally render toasts in a component. Useful for rendering toasts in native modals.
```js
// Component in native modal
<Toasts providerKey="MODAL::1" />

//...
// Root component
<Toasts /> //has default providerKey of DEFAULT

//...
// Call toast in root modal

const id = toast("Hello from root modal") //default providerKey of DEFAULT

// Native modal becomes visible
const id = toast("Hello from native modal", {providerKey: "MODAL::1"})
//Now, toast is shown only in native modal
```

If you want to persist toasts across components (i.e. when you open/close a modal and want to keep the same toasts), your toasts should be assigned a providerKey of "PERSISTS".

```js
toast("Message...", {providerKey: "PERSISTS"})
```

Or, if you cannot do so, you can update each toast manually.

```js
const { toasts } = useToasterStore(); //Note, no provider key passed in

useEffect(() => {
  toasts.forEach((t) => {
    toast(t.message, {
      ...t,
      providerKey: isModalVisible ? 'MODAL::1' : 'DEFAULT', //Switch provider key here
    });
  });
}, [isModalVisible]);
```



## Example
```js
<Toasts
  onToastPress={(t) => {
    console.log(`Toast ${t.id} was pressed.`)
  }}
  overrideDarkMode={isAppDarkMode}
  globalAnimationType="spring"
  globalAnimationConfig={{duration: 500, flingPositionReturnDuration: 200, stiffness: 50, damping: 10}}
/>
```

## Keyboard Handling

Bottom-positioned toasts will automatically move with the keyboard. This behavior can not currently be disabled.

## Screen Reader Support

If the device's screen reader is enabled, react-native-toast will not show the toast. It will announce the toast message to the user using the announceAccessibility method.
